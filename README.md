# UltimateNESemu

UltimateNESemu is a fork of Mesen, The Best NES Emulator as of the creation of this emulator.

## Releases

### Windows

The latest version is available on https://github.com/CaptainCrumb999RobloxYT/UltimateNESemu/releases).

### Ubuntu

The official releases (same downloads as the Windows builds above) also contain the Linux version of Mesen, built under Ubuntu 16 - you should be able to use that in most cases if you are using Ubuntu.

The Linux version is a standard .NET executable file and requires Mono to run - you may need to configure your environment to allow it to automatically run .exe files through Mono, or manually run UltimateNESemu by using mono (e.g: "mono UltimateNESemu.exe").

The following packages need to be installed to run UltimateNESemu:

* mono-complete
* libsdl2-2.0
* gnome-themes-standard

**Note:** **Mono 5.18 or higher is recommended**, some older versions of Mono (e.g 4.2.2) have some stability and performance issues which can cause crashes and slow down the UI.
The default Mono version in Ubuntu 18.04 is 4.6.2 (which also causes some layout issues in Mesen).  To install the latest version of Mono, follow the instructions here: https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin

**Note** **I am looking forward to releasing this emulator on macOS and FreeBSD, and eventually MS-DOS and Solaris. Also, I want to release this on mobile and consoles (SMS-Xbox Series X)

## Roadmap

List of things that should be added

* Support for more UNIF boards and more NES/Famicom input devices
